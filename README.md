# ReviewGenie
A Code Review Service that automatically analyzes code changes in a GitLab Merge Request (MR) using AI. 

ðŸ§  Simple Architecture Overview
We have built a Code Review Service that automatically analyzes code changes in a GitLab Merge Request (MR) using AI. The system is made of 3 independent services, each doing a specific job:

ðŸŸ¡ 1. GitLab Webhook Listener (Trigger Service)
      â€¢	This service is triggered when a Merge Request (MR) is created in GitLab.
      â€¢	We have set up a GitLab Webhook that sends MR details to an AWS Lambda function.
      â€¢	The Lambda function reads the incoming JSON and extracts:
          o	MR ID
          o	Project ID
          o	Action (like open, reopen, update, or merge)
      â€¢	If the action is one of these four (open, reopen, update, merge), it sends a message to AWS SQS with this information.
      ðŸ”¹ Input: MR event from GitLab
      ðŸ”¹ Output: Message in AWS SQS queue with MR details

ðŸŸ¢ 2. Gen-AI Review Service (Code Analyzer)
       This service runs as an AWS Lambda with a Docker image, which includes all AI-related dependencies and the Lambda handler.
        â€¢	It listens to SQS messages (produced by the first service).
        â€¢	When a new message arrives:
            o	If the action is open, reopen, or update:
                ï‚§	â€¢  Calls the GitLab API to fetch the MR code diffs (the files changed and the diff content).
                ï‚§	â€¢  Passes each fileâ€™s diff through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:
                ï‚§	This pipeline uses a FAISS vector index of the default branch codebase (pre-built by embedding all source code files into vector embeddings via OpenAI embeddings).
                ï‚§	For each diff, the pipeline retrieves relevant code snippets from the indexed default branch code.
                ï‚§	It generates a detailed AI-powered code review that includes high-level analysis, security issue detection, code smells, suggestions for improvement, and future risk assessment.

              o	If the action is merge:
              	After the Merge Request is successfully merged into the default branch:
              Only the code that changed as part of the merge is identified.
              ï‚§	These changed files are re-embedded (i.e., reprocessed into vector representations using OpenAI embeddings).
              ï‚§	The updated embeddings are used to update the existing FAISS index:
              ï‚§	Old embeddings for changed files are removed or replaced.
              ï‚§	New chunks and their vectors are added to the FAISS index.
              ï‚§	â€¢  This ensures that the retrieval context used in future code reviews reflects the latest version of the codebase post-merge.
              ï‚§	â€¢  This process avoids full re-indexing and focuses only on what was modified in the merge, improving efficiency.

â€¢	The final result is saved in DynamoDB, with:
    o	MR ID
    o	Project ID
    o	Analysis â€“ (AI-generated review text)
ðŸ”¹ Input: Message from SQS
ðŸ”¹ Output: Code review stored in DynamoDB under MRAnalysisResults table


Embedding Preprocessing Logic (Default Branch)
â€¢	Prior to running the Gen-AI Review Service, the default branch of the repository is processed by a separate ingestion script.
â€¢	This script recursively scans all Python source files (.py) in the codebase.
â€¢	Each file is split into chunks of manageable size (~1000 characters with overlap).
â€¢	Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations.
â€¢	All vectors and metadata (chunk source, text) are saved to persistent storage:
    o	FAISS index (index.faiss)
    o	Chunk data (chunks.json)
    o	Metadata (metadata.pkl)
â€¢	This index is loaded by the Gen-AI Review Service at runtime to provide relevant code context for diff analysis.

ðŸ”µ 3. GitLab Writer (Comment Poster)
â€¢	This service listens to DynamoDB Streams for new entries.
â€¢	When a new record is added (with MR ID, Project ID, and Analysis), it:
    o	Uses a GitLab Private Token to authenticate
    o	Finds the correct Merge Request
    o	Posts the AI-generated Analysis as a comment on the MR
â€¢	Once the comment is successfully posted, the record is deleted from DynamoDB to avoid duplicate posts.
ðŸ”¹ Input: New entry in DynamoDB
ðŸ”¹ Output: Comment added in GitLab MR
